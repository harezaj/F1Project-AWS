# F1Project-AWS
The objective of this project was to migrate a single schema, or a subset of tables and their associated data, from an on-premises project to Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a learning exercise. The goal was not to fully migrate the entire project or build a complete data warehouse, but rather to gain hands-on experience with AWS and its capabilities in order to better understand how it can be used to host and manage data.

This project allowed me to explore various AWS services and tools, such as Redshift, S3 and Lambda Functions, and learn how to use them to migrate and manage data in the cloud.
